## Changelog

### v0.1.5 - GitHub Persistence Stabilization and UI Cleanup (December 8, 2025)

*This release stabilizes the admin GitHub persistence workflow and removes deprecated hover/tooltip UI elements for a cleaner user experience.*

**GitHub Persistence Flow Improvements:**

1. **Fresh SHA Fetching Before Commit**
   - GitHub SHA is now fetched immediately before every commit operation
   - Prevents "file has changed" errors from stale SHA values
   - For PR workflow: SHA is re-fetched after branch creation
   - For direct commit: SHA is re-fetched right before the commit
   - Detailed logging tracks SHA refresh operations for troubleshooting

2. **Two-Step Workflow Stability**
   - PATCH endpoint saves changes to `public/universe/universe.json` (Step 1)
   - POST endpoint reads from disk and commits to GitHub (Step 2)
   - File content on disk is the authoritative source for commits
   - Optimistic locking prevents concurrent edit conflicts at both steps
   - Comprehensive validation before GitHub operations

3. **Enhanced Logging and Debugging**
   - Verbose logging mode with `ADMIN_VERBOSE_LOGGING=true` environment variable
   - Workflow steps clearly logged with separators and context
   - SHA fetch operations logged with hash previews
   - File read operations show byte counts and validation results
   - Each GitHub operation logged with success/failure status

**UI Improvements:**

1. **Hover Label and Tooltip Removal**
   - Removed all hover labels from celestial objects (galaxies, stars, planets, moons)
   - Eliminated tooltip components that were causing visual clutter
   - Cleaned up unused hover state variables and emissive highlighting
   - Streamlined scene components for better performance
   - Users now interact directly with objects without intermediate hover states

**Why These Changes:**

The GitHub persistence workflow needed stabilization to prevent commit failures:
- Admins were encountering "file has changed" errors when committing after saving
- Stale SHA values caused GitHub API rejections
- Fresh SHA fetching before every commit ensures accurate file state
- Clear logging helps troubleshoot any remaining edge cases

The tooltip removal improves the user experience:
- Hover labels added visual noise without clear benefit
- Direct object interaction is more intuitive
- Cleaner scene rendering improves performance
- Reduced component complexity makes maintenance easier

**Technical Details:**
- No new environment variables required
- No migration steps needed
- All existing tests passing
- Compatible with all v0.1.x releases
- Backward compatible with existing admin workflows

**Deployment Notes:**
- Optional: Set `ADMIN_VERBOSE_LOGGING=true` for detailed workflow debugging
- Review server logs for `[pushUniverseChanges]` messages to track SHA operations
- GitHub tokens with `repo` scope (and optionally `workflow`) remain required
- No changes to existing environment variable configuration

**Verification Steps:**
1. Make edits in admin interface
2. Click "💾 Save to Disk" - verify success message
3. Wait a few seconds (simulate time passing)
4. Click "Commit to GitHub" - should succeed without "file has changed" error
5. Check server logs for "Fetching current SHA from GitHub..." messages
6. Verify commit or PR appears in GitHub repository
7. Confirm no hover tooltips appear when hovering over celestial objects

See [MANUAL_TESTING.md](MANUAL_TESTING.md#scenario-11-sha-refresh-mechanism-verification) for detailed SHA refresh testing procedures.
See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md#two-step-save-workflow) for complete workflow documentation.

### v0.1.3 - Galaxy Scale and Visual Improvements (December 8, 2025)

*This release enhances the visual experience with improved galaxy scaling and refined camera positioning. Builds upon v0.1.2's admin workflow, hover labeling, and planet viewer improvements.*

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Enhanced Galaxy Scaling** (PR #58)
   - Increased minimum galaxy radius from 4 to 6 units (+50%) for better visibility in crowded universes
   - Increased maximum galaxy radius from 15 to 22 units (+47%) for improved screen presence and focus
   - Adjusted base radius from 8 to 12 units (+50%) to maintain proportional balance
   - Updated grid spacing from 30 to 50 units to prevent overlap with larger galaxies
   - Enhanced camera positioning for optimal framing at new scales
   - Added runtime validation in development mode for grid spacing sufficiency
   - **Verification**: Galaxies now have stronger visual presence while maintaining accessibility and clickability

2. **Camera Position Adjustments**
   - Universe view camera adjusted to (0, 60, 130) from (0, 50, 100) for better framing
   - Galaxy view camera adjusted to (0, 25, 50) from (0, 20, 40) for improved perspective
   - OrbitControls ranges updated: minDistance 20→30, maxDistance 200→250
   - Galaxy focus uses enhanced `calculateFocusPosition()` with distance=35, angle=40°

3. **Documentation Enhancements**
   - Added comprehensive edge case documentation for galaxy scale system
   - Documented performance considerations for larger galaxy scales (~5-10% GPU impact)
   - Enhanced visuals.md with detailed scale configuration guide
   - Added testing guidelines for galaxy scaling behavior
   - Clarified camera positioning and zoom behavior in docs

**Why These Changes Were Made:**
- Sparse universes (1-2 galaxies) needed more dramatic visual presence for immersion
- Crowded universes (50+ galaxies) needed better clickability and visual separation
- Previous galaxy sizes lacked the "wow factor" for featured content
- Camera framing needed adjustment to accommodate larger galaxy scales

**Technical Details:**
- Particle count per galaxy remains constant (2000 particles)
- Larger galaxies occupy more screen space but use same rendering pipeline
- Performance impact: ~5-10% increase in GPU time from increased screen coverage
- Frame rate targets maintained: 60 FPS desktop, 30+ FPS mobile
- All 450 unit tests reviewed (441 passing, 9 pre-existing failures in crypto polyfills)

**Deployment Notes:**
- No new environment variables required
- No migration steps needed
- Changes are purely visual and performance-related
- Backward compatible with existing universe data

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) and [docs/visuals.md](docs/visuals.md) for complete documentation.

### v0.1.2 - Critical UX Fixes and Documentation (December 2025)

*This release includes three critical fixes that restore and enhance key workflows, plus comprehensive documentation of all changes.*

**Critical Fixes Implemented:**

1. **Admin Save Flow Restoration** (ISS-4)
   - Fixed two-step save/commit workflow to properly persist changes
   - Resolved disk save operation that was failing to write `universe.json`
   - Ensured GitHub commit step correctly reads saved data from disk
   - Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting save operations
   - **Verification**: Admin can now save changes locally, then commit to GitHub without data loss

2. **Planet Layout Alignment** (ISS-5)
   - Aligned planet surface to 30/70 split layout (planet left, content right)
   - Fixed responsive behavior for tablet and mobile devices
   - Corrected camera positioning to properly frame planets on left side
   - Enhanced accessibility with proper touch targets (44-52px minimum)
   - **Verification**: Planet pages now display with consistent layout across all viewport sizes

3. **Hover Label Standardization** (ISS-6)
   - Standardized all tooltips across scenes using shared constants
   - Increased font size from 0.875rem to 1rem for better readability
   - Positioned tooltips consistently above objects to prevent overlap
   - Unified colors, padding, and borders across all interactive elements
   - Added `SceneTooltip` component with distance-based scaling
   - **Verification**: All celestial objects show consistent, readable labels on hover

## Universe Data

The universe is defined in `public/universe/universe.json` following a hierarchical structure:

```
Universe → Galaxies → Solar Systems → Planets → Moons
                   → Stars (free-floating)
```

For detailed schema documentation, see [docs/universe-schema.md](docs/universe-schema.md).

### Example Data Access

```typescript
import { getGalaxies, getPlanetById } from '@/lib/universe';

// Get all galaxies
const galaxies = await getGalaxies();

// Get a specific planet
const earth = await getPlanetById('earth');
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests for data validation and loading:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Content Management

### Admin Interface

The Horizon includes a password-protected admin interface for editing universe content directly through your browser.

**Access**: Navigate to `/admin` and log in with your admin password.

**Features**:
- 🔒 Password-protected access with signed session tokens (Web Crypto API)
- 🛡️ Timing-safe authentication preventing timing attacks
- 🚫 Rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes) to prevent brute force
- ⚡ Edge Runtime compatible for serverless deployments
- ✏️ CRUD operations for galaxies, solar systems, planets, and moons
- 📝 Built-in markdown editor with live preview
- 🔄 GitHub integration for automatic commits and pull requests
- ✅ Real-time validation against the universe schema
- 🔐 Optimistic locking to prevent concurrent edit conflicts
- 📋 Sanitized error logging (no token exposure)

### Using the Admin Interface

The admin interface uses a **two-step workflow** for safe content management:

**Step 1: Save to Disk**
1. Navigate to `/admin` and log in with your admin password
2. Click "Edit" on any galaxy to modify its properties
3. Make your changes in the editor
4. Click "Save Changes" to save to memory
5. Click "💾 Save to Disk" to persist changes to `public/universe/universe.json`
6. Verify success message appears

**Step 2: Commit to GitHub** (requires GitHub credentials)
1. Enter a descriptive commit message
2. Choose to either:
   - Create a Pull Request (recommended for review)
   - Commit directly to the main branch
3. Click "🔀 Create PR" or "✓ Commit to GitHub"
4. Changes will be pushed to GitHub and trigger automatic redeployment

**Why Two Steps?**
- **Safety**: Test changes locally before committing
- **Flexibility**: Make multiple edits and save incrementally
- **Review**: Create PRs for team review
- **Recovery**: Changes persist even if session expires

**Monitoring**:
- Check server logs for detailed operation tracking
- Look for `[PATCH /api/admin/universe]` and `[POST /api/admin/universe]` log messages
- Verify `public/universe/universe.json` was updated locally
- Check GitHub for commits or PRs

See [docs/content-authoring.md](docs/content-authoring.md) for complete workflow documentation.

### Manual Content Editing

You can also edit `public/universe/universe.json` directly:

1. Edit `public/universe/universe.json`
2. Follow the schema defined in `docs/universe-schema.md`
3. Include markdown content for planets and moons
4. Run validation: `npm run dev` and check console for warnings
5. Test your changes locally

### Content Guidelines

- Use proper markdown formatting
- Keep IDs in kebab-case (e.g., `milky-way`)
- Include meaningful descriptions
- Validate JSON syntax before committing

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for local development:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
